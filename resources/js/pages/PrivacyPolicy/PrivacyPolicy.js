        interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in
        the future.

      <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
        websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&apos;s
        reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in
        the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
        collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
        information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being
        shared, and to comply with this policy.
      </p>

        http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
      </p>
      <h4>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
        <li>
          Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
          home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after
          entering our website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
          home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after
          entering our website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &apos;Privacy&apos;, and can
          be easily be found on the page specified above.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy
        Policy Page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are able to change their personal information by emailing or
        calling us.
      </p>
      <h4>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h4>
      <p>
        We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use
        advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
      </p>
      <h4>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h4>
      <p>
        It&apos;s also important to note that we do not allow third party
        behavioral tracking. This means that we do not allow any third party
        services, such as online marketing & advertising providers, to monitor
        and track how you use our website. We understand the value of your
        privacy; we have invested significant resources into protecting your
        data.
      </p>
      <h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
        under 13, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
        parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation&apos;s
        consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
        what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
        children&apos;s privacy and safety online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          We do not specifically market to children under 13, intentionally or
          otherwise.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>
      <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
        law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We adhere to the Fair Information Practices. We encrypt your personal
        information using a combination of encryption algorithms to ensure that
        your information is kept safe and secure. Although highly unlikely, it
        is possible for an unauthorized person to gain access to the data stored
        in any of our databases. All sensitive information contained within any
        database is encrypted prior to being saved to the database making it
        practically impossible to read the data in plain text as it was
        originally entered into said database. In the event of a data breach, we
        will notify all users via email within seven (7) business days. We will
        also post a notification on the homepage of our website within seven (7)
        business days.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that
        individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against
        data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
        principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
        against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
        a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
        data processors.
      </p>
      <h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>
      <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
        establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
        right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
        tough penalties for violations.
      </p>
      <h4>We collect your email address in order to:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or
          questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to
          orders.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also send you additional information related to your product
          and/or service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients
          after the original transaction has occurred.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        We are 100% CANSPAM compliant! To be CANSPAM compliant, we agree to:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>NOT use false or misleading subjects.</li>
        <li>
          NOT use false or misleading email addresses as the sender of the
          email.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
        </li>

          Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is
          used.
